# How to run

First, obtain your PubNub keys from signing up <a href="https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup?devrel_gh=PubNubRide">here</a>. After creating a PubNub app, you will receive your subsrcibe and publish keys, which you will need to input in the Constants.java class. 

You will also need your Google Maps API keys. Create a Google Cloud Platform account in order to use google maps APIs, which will power a large portion of the app. From the API manager, enable the Google Maps Android API, Directions API, and Places API. You can obtain your keys from the credentials tab. Your key will need to go in the Constants.java file, as well as the AndroidManifest and Home.java files. 


After including the relevant keys, build the project in Android Studio and run it through a connected device or an AVD. Note: the first build may take a while; <a href="https://github.com/lovdeep7/SelfDrivingApp">here</a> is a barebones version of this project.
